# Project Overview

This is a website for Dra. Camila Santos Castilho, a general practitioner. The project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications. It uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for static typing and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.

The website has a simple, clean design and is easy to navigate. The home page features a hero section with a call-to-action to schedule an appointment.

## Building and Running

To get started with the project, you first need to install the dependencies using your favorite package manager:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

This will start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Development Conventions

The project follows the standard Next.js project structure. The `app` directory contains the pages of the application. The `components` directory contains the reusable components. The `public` directory contains the static assets, such as images and fonts.

The project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to enforce a consistent coding style. You can run the linter with the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```
